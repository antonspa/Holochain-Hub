The visual patterns of Holochain Hubs and their web representations should resemble or copy the cues 
already in use by Holochain and their websites.
This way it will be easily recognisable no matter what name you give to your Hub.

For starters I added a simple logo (holochain_hub.png) 


Please feel free to add your ideas to this concept,
I dont have time to work on this very often, afterall, it is still in an idea phase.
 
Ii is also maybe too soon to be planning for such concept so this project has a lower priority for me now.
