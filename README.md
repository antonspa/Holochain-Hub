# Holochain-Hub
Gathering of ideas and best practices essential in creating physical Holochain co-work/co-create/co-living spaces. 

The idea originted in this forum thread https://forum.holochain.org/t/how-about-the-idea-of-holochainhubs/



The goal is to have a concept and a manual for creating open networking spaces with outside fluctuation. 
It should attract not only Holochain members but also people from other communities.

A Holochain hub should also invite people and facilitate events from other areas and other projects within the P2P "industry", alternative economy, progressive governance models space and so on. This approach should help upkeep the diversity of ideas and opinions in various domains, but also invite people from other spheres into the ideas of Holochain.

This could enable a varied and vibrant creative environment.
